Zappy
=====

Zappy is a wonderful (not playable) game. In this game, you watch an artificial intelligence gathering resources in a virtual world. When a good amount of resources is reached, they call their friends and start elevation. The game is won when a group has reached the 8th level.


This a big project combining 4 different parts :

+ A game server written in C
+ An AI client written in OCaml
+ A viewer written in C# with XNA (works on windows & windows phone 7)
+ A drone written in python which allow human to interact with several AI client
+ We worked on it 2 month and 11 days our second year as students at Epitech Rennes and we had to make it from scratch (except for the "viewer" part).
